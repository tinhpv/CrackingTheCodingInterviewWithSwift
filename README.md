# Cracking The Coding Interview With Swift (2021)
In the repository, you cand find my approaches for algorithms of Cracking The Coding Interview(6th Edition) in Swift.

I know, admittedly, it is more challenging to find optimal solutions for some algorithm questions in Swift than other languages such Java, C+, or Phyton. Therefore, I wanted to bring my swift way solutions of Cracking The Coding Interview(6th edition) Book.


Some solution has been refered from https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Swift and https://github.com/ikhsan/ctci-swift
