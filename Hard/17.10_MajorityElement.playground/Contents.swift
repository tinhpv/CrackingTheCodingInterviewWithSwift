 MajorityElement: A majority element is an element that makes up more than half of the items in an array. Given a positive integers array, find the majority element. If there is no majority element, return -1. Do this in O(N) time and 0(1) space.
 Input: 1 2 5 9 5 9 5 5 5
 Output: 5

/*
 Each time we terminate the validate step, the subarray has no majority element. This means that there are at least as many non-7s as there are 7s. Although we're essentially removing this subarray from the original array, the majority element will still be found in the rest of the array-and will still have majority status. Therefore, at some point, we will discover the majority element.
 Our algorithm can now be run in two passes: one to find the possible majority element and another to valiÂ­ date it. Rather than using two variables to count (countYes and countNo), we'll just use a single count variable that increments and decrements.
